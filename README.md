# HelloWorld
This repository contains the code for the HelloWorld Program.

This program was developed for the fourth Exercise in the course "Wissenschaftliches arbeiten" at the University of Regensburg.
This repository contains the source code, as well as the compiled code. To run the compiled code on windows, open CMD and change the current directory by typing cd and adding the Path to the location of the Folder containing Program on your PC.
After that type. HelloWorld.exe and the code will be executed. Antivirus software such as Aviea may block the execution and has to be deactivated for this.
If you want to compile the Sorcecode yourself instead do the following first: Install the GCC compiler from: "http://www.mingw.org/wiki/howto_install_the_mingw_gcc_compiler_suite" Open CMD. Change your directory to the location of the Sourcecode using cd. Type the following:  gcc -std=c99 HelloWorld.c -o HelloWorld.exe
